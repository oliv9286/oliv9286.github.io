Open *demo.html* to see a list of all the glyphs in Friendly Icons Font along with its codes/ligatures.

If you prefer to render your own version of Friendly Icons Font using font rendering app (such as icomoon.io or fontello.com) containing only certain icons, use the files in the SVG folder.

You won't need any of the files located under the *demo-files* directory when including the generated font in your own projects.
